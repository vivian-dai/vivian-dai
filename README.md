## Random Intro
<details>
<summary>If you're looking at this because of an application... please don't read this. If you're a friend stalking my Github, you're free to read this lol:</summary>

I'm watching üëÄ  
Hey, I'm Vivian Dai but if you're here, you're most likely a buddy of mine who decided to stalk my Github so I guess you already knew that. I will say lots of seemingly out of context things like "‚òï = üç©" or "this quark has a strange flavor" but I swear I'm not insane and all these make sense :D  
Let's talk about monkeys. Have you heard of the [million monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) before? If you have a million monkeys who each spend a million years typing at a typewriter, somewhere, eventually, collectively, the entire works of Shakespeare will be typed out. In one of Janet Tashjian's works (I think this is right), it mentions the works of Shakespeare will not be the only thing that gets typed out. Somewhere along the way, several other important works will be typed out as well. However, most of the things the monkeys type is still giberish. This theorem is an accurate representation of how I work. I am but a mindless monkey who types things until things work. üêí  
Ok now if for whatever reason you're not reading this for fun.... uh check it out! I have a sense of humor! That's a good asset to the team!

## Code
<details>
<summary>Here's some hopefully maybe cool coding related stuff I do:</summary>
<div align="center">

I use a bunch of different languages but usually lean towards Python. A lot of things I've done also aren't in my own repositories so feel free to scrape Github and figure out what I've committed to that probably belongs to a friend of mine.

### Hackathons
<details>
<summary>I think the right thing to say is "go check out my <a href="https://devpost.com/viviandai">Devpost</a>"</summary>
I guess I'll only list the hackathons where we won stuff:

|Repository|Description|
|-|-|
|[![YRHacks](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=KathleenX7&repo=YRHacks&theme=tokyonight&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/KathleenX7/YRHacks)|[*YRHacks 2021*](https://yrhacks.devpost.com/): our team built a project showcasing the effects actions have the environment (and turtles) and won the sustainability prize.|
</details>

### Projects
<details>
<summary>I'll showcase some of my cooler projects here</summary>
For now.... go check out my pins, I'll update this later by thoughally explaining some cooler projects.
</details>

### Writeups
<details>
<summary>A writeup written by me is most likely just a dump of thought process.</summary>

#### CTFs
<details>
<summary>I like attempting CTFs from time to time. The keyword here is definitely "attemping" since I'm not exactly great at them.</summary>

I plan to do more CTFs and only include major ones later.  
|Repository|Description|
|-|-|
|[![PicoCTF 2021 writeup](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=vivian-dai&repo=picoCTF2021-Writeup&theme=tokyonight&show_owner=true)](https://vivian-dai.github.io/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/)|[*PicoCTF 2021*](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2021-spring.html): our team ranked 353<sup>rd</sup> globally and 29<sup>th</sup> in Canada|
|[![angstromCTF 2021 Writeup](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=vivian-dai&repo=angstromCTF-2021-Writeup&theme=tokyonight&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/vivian-dai/angstromCTF-2021-Writeup)|[*Angstrom CTF 2021*](https://2021.angstromctf.com/): a 100% random CTF I attended. My team ranked 457<sup>th</sup>|
</details>

#### Others
<details>
<summary>My non CTF writeups I thought might be worth a mention</summary>

I swear I'm 100% qualified to be making writeups on other things:  
|Repository|Description|
|-|-|
|[![CCC solutions](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=vivian-dai&repo=CCC-solutions&theme=tokyonight&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/vivian-dai/CCC-solutions)|[CCC](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc) is the closest I'm ever going to get to competitive programming. I'll add more questions later.|

## Cool People
<details>
<summary>Giving shoutouts to some cool people</summary>

People are put here in order of response time to my asking for consent to adding them here.  
|Cool Person|Description|
|-|-|
|[![EmeraldEntities](https://github.com/EmeraldEntities.png) EmeraldEntites](https://github.com/EmeraldEntities)|This guy taught me the basics of Github and is the only person who will ever tolerate (and be willing to create) anything that's RGB cyclic. Also a fun arson buddy + mastermind to plan kidnappings with.|
|[![beepboop271](https://github.com/beepboop271.png) beepboop271](https://github.com/beepboop271)|Taught me some Github tips and tricks like `.gitattributes` and suggested I should do something about my uh previously 50+ completely useless repos. Also taught me some CTF things which made me really disappointed in myself.|
|[![sherwinchiu](https://github.com/sherwinchiu.png) sherwinchiu](https://github.com/sherwinchiu/)|Has an interesting dynamic with capacitors. Also has really cool project ideas which has resulted in me doing a bunch of projects with him. Throws great wisdom about stonks and other topics too.|
|[![shari09](https://github.com/shari09.png) shari09](https://github.com/shari09)|Best senpai. Taught me how to teach. Also senpai is super charismatic (enough to have an effect coined after her) and is a great arson and kidnapping target (tell senpai to sleep). The most passionate adversary to me touching UI/UX.|
|[![KathleenX7](https://github.com/KathleenX7.png) KathleenX7](https://github.com/KathleenX7)|My CP skills probably improved a lot due to her asking me questions (now is one of my go-to people to ask about CP questions if I ever do them). Someone I spam offer to do projects with (before heading off and completing the project on my own, whoops üòÖ). The only member of my go-to hackathon team who is willing to read code.|
|[![cleibox](https://github.com/cleibox.png) cleibox](https://github.com/cleibox)|This kid's profile pictures are never normal. My go-to virus tester. Also favourite stalking target. This kid probably still thinks I'm a hacker. One of the members of my go-to hackathon team.|
|[![xiaoqi987209](https://github.com/xiaoqi987209.png) xiaoqi987209](https://github.com/xiaoqi987209)|Aiya someone's username is a bully. One day I should ask what all those numbers mean. Says "water is dry" to spite me. Another member of my go-to hackathon team who has been getting through each hackathon without touching a single piece of code.|
